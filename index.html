    <h3>Pasta</h3>  
    <p>Pasta (Italian pronunciation: [ˈpasta]) is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of durum wheat flour (semolina) mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine. Nothing is better than a classic Italian-seasoned meat sauce pasta topped with cheese. Accompanied by an order of breadsticks, this is truly a pasta you can't refuse. Serves 2.</p>

    <h3>Pizza</h3>  
    <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. In formal settings, like a restaurant, pizza is eaten with knife and fork, but in casual settings it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand. Small pizzas are sometimes called pizzettas. Your favorite cheese pizza made with classic marinara sauce topped with mozzarella cheese. Order pizza online now.</p>

    <h3>Dessert</h3>
    <p>Dessert (/dɪˈzɜːrt/) is a course that concludes a meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods, such as confections dishes or fruit, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine or liqueur, however in the United States it may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items regarded as a separate course elsewhere. In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal. Calling all chocolate lovers!
